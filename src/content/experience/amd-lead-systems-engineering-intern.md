## Highlights

- Automated stress and stability diagnostics for desktop CPUs with Bash scripting; implemented timed termination, checkpointing, performance counter logging, and automated software install routines to streamline validation workflow.
- Developed an internal CPU performance analysis tool in python to process CPU telemetry and generate comparative visualizations of core frequency, temperature, and over 50 metrics recorded during single and multi-core benchmarks.
- Configured rack-style test setups with KVM, BIOS management tools, and network access configurations to support automated, multi-system platform validation for next-gen Ryzen processors.


## Scope

I support AMD's LSE Desktop group by transforming early-silicon systems into reliable validation platforms, coordinating firmware tweaks, lab infrastructure, and documentation so engineers across silicon, BIOS, and platform teams can resolve issues faster.
