## Highlights

- Built a modular simulation bench with STM32H7 Nucleo boards that emulates MIL-STD-1553 and CAN traffic, unlocking high-fidelity testing of upgraded QPSK telemetry links.
- Supported migration to STM32H7 controllers by benchmarking protocol performance, enabling an increase in surface data rates from 40 Kbit/s to over 200 Kbit/s.
- Prototyped SD-card-based logging as a drop-in replacement for NAND modules, improving serviceability and tool turnaround in the field.
- Authored a thread-safe FATFS driver supporting read, write, append, and directory operations for embedded telemetry workloads.

## Scope

I collaborate with firmware, hardware, and operations teams to de-risk next-generation downhole telemetry—pairing bench simulations with embedded software to validate integration paths before tools reach the field.
