## Highlights

- Led prototyping of a battery management system that triggers protective faults based on current, voltage, and temperature telemetry.
- Designed an ESP32-driven wireless firmware update path that leverages the STM32 UART bootloader for OTA updates and debug.
- Built CAN protocol tests on STM32 hardware, qualifying a cost-effective transceiver with C firmware and heartbeat diagnostics.
- Incubated new features on rapid prototypes before they were integrated into production boards, boosting system reliability.

## Scope

Within Longhorn Racing Solar, I bridge hardware and firmware to ensure our protection electronics keep pace with race-day demands, validating every change in the lab before it reaches the car.
