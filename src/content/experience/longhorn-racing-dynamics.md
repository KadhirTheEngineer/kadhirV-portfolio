## Highlights

- Built an Arduino-powered shock testing rig and companion Python analysis pipeline to characterize spring rates, damping, and pressure effects.
- Modeled suspension geometry in SolidWorks with parametric workflows that cut component mass by 12%.

## Scope

I partnered with mechanical and race operations leads to validate chassis upgrades, combining instrumentation, data processing, and CAD iterations to translate test results into on-track gains.
