## Highlights

- Co-designed motion-control stack combining STM32 firmware and FPGA coprocessors for deterministic trajectories.
- Delivered calibration tooling and data pipelines that cut bring-up time by 4x across production lines.
- Partnered with mechanical leads to implement safety interlocks and diagnostics for 24/7 operation.

## Scope

MotionCraft builds custom robotics for semiconductor inspection. I drove the embedded roadmap from evaluation boards to production hardware, ensuring repeatability, diagnostics, and integration with customer MES systems.
