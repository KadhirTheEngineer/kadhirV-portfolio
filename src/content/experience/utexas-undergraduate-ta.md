- Provide detailed feedback on 100+ assignments and assessments while hosting office hours for one-on-one support.

## ES-301 - Intro to engineering design & Problem solving

This course is designed for non-engineering majors to take as a gateway to engineering and problem solving. This project-based course is meant to provide an intuitive understanding of real world concepts.

### Student projects:
- Camera Obscura (Pinhole camera) - design a lightproof pinhole camera from recycled materials to be used by people with dexterity issues. Learn about iterative design/testing and suiting customer needs
- Children's toy - Understand existing design of a children's hand crank flashlight and reverse engineer it to make improvements.
- Balsa towers - Understand structures and design a balsa tower within restrcitions to withstand a simulated earthquake. Observe effects, design a method of earthquake protection (counterweights, stronger structures, pendulums, etc.) and retest under similar conditions.
- Electronic music - Understand how arduino works, design a circuit involving potentiometers and buzzers to play music

## Scope

I work closely with Dr. Shannon Stokes to keep project teams on track, reinforcing core concepts and creating space for students to troubleshoot designs in real time.
