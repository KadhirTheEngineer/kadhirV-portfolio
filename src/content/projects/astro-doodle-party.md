## Summary

AstroDoodle.party reimagines arcade doodle games with physical LED wands that translate real-world gestures into on-screen action through a custom vision pipeline.

## Highlights

- Captured wand motion with an OpenCV pipeline that combines intuitive color calibration, dynamic calibration for lighting shifts, masking, and point-cloud generation before gesture classification.
- Sequenced gestures into real-time browser gameplay using a TypeScript engine tuned for low-latency controls.
- Printed and integrated custom LED wands with embedded motion tracking hardware for an immersive play experience.

## Outcome

The project won 1st Place Overall and Best Design at HackTX 2025 (out of 225+ submissions) after a 24-hour build, highlighting the team’s end-to-end rapid prototyping skills.
