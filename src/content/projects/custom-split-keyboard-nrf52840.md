## Summary

I engineered a from-scratch ergonomic split keyboard — from PCB layout through firmware — optimized for ultra-low power wireless use and everyday reliability.

## Highlights

- Designed custom PCBs around the nRF52840 to enable sub-16 mm stack height while maintaining full mechanical key travel.
- Developed Zephyr- and ZMK-based firmware supporting multi-layer layouts, macros, and mouse movement without sacrificing battery life.
- Printed a custom enclosure and plate stack-up tuned for ergonomics, balance, and component protection.

## Outcome

The keyboard has become my daily driver, proving out the embedded stack and demonstrating the advantages of tailored ergonomics and firmware flexibility.
