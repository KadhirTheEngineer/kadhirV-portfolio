## Summary

This follow-on keyboard project explores richer I/O and firmware features, leveraging the RP2040 microcontroller to deliver responsive typing with live feedback.

## Highlights

- Engineered RP2040-based PCBs that integrate OLED displays and rotary encoders for real-time visualizations and control.
- Built multi-layer firmware with programmable macros and custom drivers for display updates and mouse emulation.
- Implemented an on-device autocorrect engine using a tree-based data structure to infer words from keypress patterns and correct typos on the fly.

## Outcome

The platform serves as a testbed for advanced input UX, proving that embedded typing aids and configurability can coexist in a compact split keyboard.
