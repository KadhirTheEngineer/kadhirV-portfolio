## Summary

Nurture aggregates real-time shelter availability and plots it on an interactive map so people experiencing homelessness can quickly find open beds and services.

## Highlights

- Implemented a Flask API backed by Firebase Realtime Database to ingest, normalize, and serve shelter metadata.
- Built a Leaflet-powered React interface that displays live markers, detail popovers, and accessibility filters for rapid scanning.
- Coordinated team workflows around a shared JSON schema so volunteers and staff can contribute updates without breaking the data model.

## Outcome

Won the 3rd Place Team Prize at CodeFest 2021 for delivering a practical navigation tool for social service organizations.
