## Summary

Sonic Vision is a wearable device that translates ultrasonic range data into haptic cues, offering affordable assistance for people with partial blindness.

## Highlights

- Designed a topology-optimized, 3D-printed headset that balances comfort with sensor placement.
- Engineered control algorithms to synchronize ultrasonic sensors, minimizing interference and keeping obstacle detection accurate within 10 feet.
- Integrated haptic feedback patterns that map distance and direction into intuitive guidance.

## Outcome

The concept reached the semi-finals of an engineering-wide hackathon, validating both the design and the accessibility impact of the approach.
